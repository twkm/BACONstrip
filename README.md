# BACONstrip Minimal CSS Framework

BACONstrip is a stripped-down responsive grid and front-end framework, ideal for making microsites and single-page sites without much overhead.

BACONstrip is also extremely customizable using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). You can specify the selectors you want to use including the grid container, rows, and columns, allowing you to customize your own grid selectors or retrofit an existing grid system.
