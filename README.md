# BACONstrip Minimal CSS Framework

BACONstrip is a stripped-down Sass responsive grid and front-end framework, ideal for making microsites and single-page sites without much overhead.

BACONstrip is also extremely customizable using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). You can specify the selectors you want to use including the grid container, rows, and columns, allowing you to customize your own grid selectors or retrofit an existing grid system.

This system is based heavily on the [Sass Version of Skeleton](https://github.com/WhatsNewSaes/Skeleton-Sass) by Seth Coelen, and by extension the [Skeleton Responsive CSS Boilerplate](http://getskeleton.com/).
